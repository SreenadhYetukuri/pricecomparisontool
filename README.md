This Python code implements a simple price comparison tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Imports:

1.tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library.
2.requests: Library for making HTTP requests.
3.time: Provides various time-related functions.
4.sqlite3: Library for SQLite database operations.


Database Setup:

1.Establishes a connection to an SQLite database named price_data.db.
2.Creates a table named prices if it doesn't exist, with columns for the product name, Amazon price, and Google price.


Database Functions:

insert_into_db: Inserts data into the SQLite database table.


Search Functionality:

1.search: Gets the product name from the entry widget.
2.Sends requests to a price comparison API (price-analytics.p.rapidapi.com) for Amazon and Google prices.
3.Polls the API to get the results after a delay (120 seconds in this case).
4.Updates the GUI labels with the retrieved Amazon and Google prices.
5.Inserts the product name, Amazon price, and Google price into the SQLite database.
6.Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Creates a Tkinter window titled "Price Comparison".
Includes labels and an entry field for entering the product name.
Provides a "Search" button to trigger the search functionality.
Displays labels for showing the Amazon and Google prices.


Main Loop:

Starts the Tkinter event loop to run the GUI application.
Database Connection Closing:

Closes the connection to the SQLite database when the Tkinter event loop exits.
This code can be useful for users to quickly compare prices of a product on Amazon and Google within the specified country (in this case, India) and store the results for future reference. It provides a simple interface for conducting price comparisons efficiently.
